The hardware for Enigma consists of three main parts:

- Keyboard
- Lampboard
- Rotor Configuration Interface (RCI)

All three systems connect to a Raspberry Pi Pico on a PCB, which runs the code.

## Keyboard
The keyboard consists of 26 push-buttons screwed onto a wooden board. The buttons are soldered into a 5x5 diode matix, which is in turn soldered to a Sparkfun [SX1509 Expander Breakout board.](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-16-output-i-o-expander-breakout-sx1509.html).
